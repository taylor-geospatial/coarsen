    """Simplify a polygonal coverage with shared edges kept identical.

    Tolerance uses input coordinate units; the removal threshold is tolerance².
    All array elements form one coverage, regardless of array shape. Return the
    original shape (or a Geometry for scalar Geometry input), like Shapely 2.1.
    With simplify_boundary=False, simplify only edges used by exactly two rings.
    Threads must be a positive integer or None (Rayon's default pool).

    The input should form a valid coverage; invalid inputs are not repaired.
    This is the GEOS 3.13.1 algorithm; later GEOS releases can produce other bytes.
    WKB conversion uses Shapely; Rust parses, simplifies, and writes without the GIL.
